Missing Values:
Some columns may have missing values, and ML algorithms generally require complete datasets. Strategies include filling missing values, removing rows, or imputing values.


Data Types:
ML algorithms often work with numerical data. If your data contains non-numeric types (e.g., categorical or text data), preprocessing steps are needed, such as encoding categorical variables or converting text to numerical representations.


Outliers:
Outliers can impact the performance of some ML models. Identifying and handling outliers may be necessary.


Imbalanced Classes:
In classification problems, imbalanced classes (significant differences in the number of instances for each class) can affect model performance. Techniques like resampling or using different evaluation metrics may be needed.


Feature Scaling:
Some ML algorithms are sensitive to the scale of features. Scaling features to a similar range (e.g., using Min-Max scaling or Standardization) may be necessary.


Correlated Features:
Highly correlated features can cause multicollinearity issues. Identifying and addressing correlated features can be important.


Non-Numeric Labels:
For classification problems, the labels should be numeric. If labels are non-numeric, encoding them into numeric values may be necessary.

Non-Representative Data:

The dataset may not be representative of the real-world scenario, leading to poor generalization. Collecting more diverse data or addressing biases may be necessary.

Complex Relationships:
Some ML models assume linear relationships between features and the target. For complex relationships, more advanced models or feature engineering may be required.

Overfitting or Underfitting:
Models may overfit (capturing noise in the training data) or underfit 
(not capturing the underlying patterns). Tuning model parameters or using different models can address this.
